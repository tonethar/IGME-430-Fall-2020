# Week-8 (10/13/20 & 10/15/20)

## I. Overview

## II. Software Design Patterns

- What are Design Patterns?
  - Reusable solution to a commonly occuring problem
  - Makes communication between developers easier
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern
  - https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
- Presentations/Resources:
  - see the "Week 6.2 HTTP Server Design" video
  - see the accompanying PDF 
- Assignments:
  - there was a HTTP Server Design Study Guide that had you research a JavaScript software design pattern and discuss it
  
## III. Databases
  - Database Management Systems (or DBMS) are applications designed for managing and organizing collections of data
  - Traditional systems typically store *records* (i.e. *rows*) of data in *tables*
    - think "Excel spreadsheet" with rows representing individual records, and columns representing various fields or attributes of each record
    - languages like SQL ("Structured Query Language") - ex. `SELECT {firstName,lastName} FROM Customers WHERE id='11234'` - are used to pull records from the database
  - In this course we will be using MongoDB (and Redis in conjunction with Mongo to create a *distributed* database
    - MongoDB stores its data as *Documents* (sim to "SQL Records") that are contained in *Collections* (sim to "SQL Tables")
      - https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/cpp/documents/
      - MongoDB documents are composed of key:value pairs in a format know as BSON ("Binary JSON") - sim to JSON but with more available data types - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSON
      
   **Mongo Document example**
 
 ```json
 let mydoc = {
    _id: ObjectId("5099803df3f4948bd2f98391"),
    name: { first: "Alan", last: "Turing" },
    birth: new Date('Jun 23, 1912'),
    death: new Date('Jun 07, 1954'),
    contribs: [ "Turing machine", "Turing test", "Turingery" ], views : NumberLong(1250000)
}
 ```
