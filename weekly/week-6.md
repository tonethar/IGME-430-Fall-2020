# Week-6 (9/29/20 & 10/01/20)

## I. Overview
- This week we are talking about *tools* that will make your developer life easier!
  - [`nodemon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is a tool that will restart your node server every time you modify a file (HS, HTML, CSS) and save the changes
  - [`babel`](https://babeljs.io/repl/) is a tool that will *transpile* our modern [ES6](http://es6-features.org/#Constants) or [ES7+](https://davidwalsh.name/es7-es8-features) JavaScript (in our case, we're only using it on the client-side) into more widely adopted ES5 JavaScript

## II. Transpiling with Babel

- Here's some newer JS features we'd like to try:
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator
- But these features don't work in all recent browsers - what to do?
  - https://babeljs.io/
  
## III. Nodemon & Babel Demo

- Start code: https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/Nodemon-Babel-Class-Example (also linked in Week 5 of myCourses)
- There is a YouTube Video walkthrough of this demo linked in "Week 5 Videos" in myCourses 
- See the "NodemonBabel" PDF Guide in "Week 5" in myCourses 
- The completed version of this demo is in myCourses (in Week 5 content section, under "DONE FILES")

1. `npm install --save-dev nodemon @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/cli`

  - If you are on Mac OS and run into issues like **gyp: No Xcode or CLT version detected!**:

    - https://developer.apple.com/download/more/

2. Check **package.json** `"devDependencies"` to see what was installed

3. Add a script to your **package.json** - `"nodemon" : "nodemon --watch ./src ./src/server.js"`

4. Run it with `npm run nodemon`

5. Modify one or the files in your `src` folder - you will see the server reboot

6. ... now we'll move on the babel ...

7. Open up **.babelrc** - and take a look - for now it is compiling to ES5 - we're not going to change this for now - but this file IS required for bable to work

8. Add a script to your **package.json** - `"build" : "babel ./client --out-file ./hosted/bundle.js"`

    - this is going to transpile your ***client-side*** JavaScript and put the results of the compilation into **/hosted/bundle.js**

9. Go ahead and make a **hosted** folder

10. Move **client.html** into the **hosted** folder

11. Move the JS from **client.html** into a file named **client.js**, and put that file in the **client** folder

12. Delete the "babel" script tags from **client.html**

13. Link to our (soon to be) transpiled JS code - `<script src="/bundle.js"></script>`

14. Change **htmlResponses.js** to point at new location of **client.html** (in the **hosted** folder)

15. Write code to load **bundle.js** 

16. Write a `getBundle` function - the `content-type` is `'application/javascript'`

17. In **server.js** modify `urlStruct` to serve up **/bundle.js**

18. Now we can `npm run build`
    - check the **hosted** folder to see **bundle.js**
    - open up **bundle.js** to see the transpiled JavaScript
    - go ahead and edit **client.js** to and `npm run build` again, and then check **bundle.js** to see the changes
    - don't edit **bundle.js** (your changes will get continually wiped out)
    - `npm run build` and then `npm run nodemon` to see it functioning (check the browser to see that **bundle.js** is getting loaded)
  
19. But ... if I change my **client.js** code with `nodemon` running, the updates won't get triggered

20. Add a script to your **package.json** - `"watch" : "babel --watch ./client --out-file ./hosted/bundle.js"`

21. `npm run watch` - now if I make a change to **client.js**, I will see it in **bundle.js** (but the server doesn't work!)

22. So, we need to have  `npm run watch` & `npm run nodemon` running at the same time:
    - Solution #1 - two Terminal (or GitBash or whatever) windows running at same time
    - Solution #2 - Use unix `fg` and `bg` commands - https://www.thegeekdiary.com/understanding-the-job-control-commands-in-linux-bg-fg-and-ctrlz/ 

23. And we'll need to add `--watch ./hosted` to our `"nodemon"` script

24. Test it. Editing **client.js** will recompile **bundle.js** and relaunch the server for us

25. Almost there! We still need to get to recognize changes to **client.html**

26. Add this to the `"nodemon"` script - `-e js,html,css` - the `e` stands for "extension" - now nodemon will watch **.js**, **.html**, and **.css** files for changes (and will reboot the server when it sees them)

27. Once it's set up - all of this nodemon capability makes your developer life easier!
    - *is using `nodemon` required?* - **NO**
    - *is using `babel` required?* - **YES** - it is required on Project 2

## IV. Nodemon & Babel Resources
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon
- https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-core
- https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env - `preset-env` (in the **.babelrc** file) will transform all ES2015-ES2020 code to be ES5 compatible
- https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli
