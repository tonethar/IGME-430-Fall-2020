# Week-6 (9/29/20 & 10/01/20)

## I. Overview
- This week we are talking about *tools* that will make your developer life easier!

## II. Transpiling with Babel

- Here's some newer JS features we'd like to try:
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator
- But these features don't work in all recent browsers - what to do?
  - https://babeljs.io/
  
## III. Nodemon & Babel Demo

- https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/Nodemon-Babel-Class-Example (also linked in Week 5 of myCourses)
