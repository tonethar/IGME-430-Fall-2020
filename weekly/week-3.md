# Week-3 (9/08/20 & 9/10/20)

## I. *Simple HTTP HW*

- Let's review it

<hr>

## II. *Steaming Media Assignment* Notes

- It's due tomorrow night
- If you are stuck on anything, hang around after class

### II-A. More on HTTP Protocol

- Let's discuss how a browser downloads and assembles a web page - head to this demo in Chrome or Firefox, and open the Web Inspector:
 - http://igm.rit.edu/~acjvks/courses/shared/430/simple-server-request-demo/middle-aged-man.html
 
### II-B. In-class Demo
- Let's add an image to the landing page of our HW - Node Simple Web API:
  - Instructions: https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-430-Shared/blob/master/notes/HW-node-simple-web-api.md
  - Current state of landing page (no image): https://dorkus-jokes.herokuapp.com/
  - Here's the image we want to use - it is hosted at igm.rit.edu: http://igm.rit.edu/~acjvks/courses/shared/430/simple-server-request-demo/images/mam.jpg
  - GOAL: Get this image to appear on the bottom of the landing page - so EASY!
  - PROBLEM: This is called "inlining" - and we are using someone else's server to display an image - sooner or later they will notice and/or the file will get moved or deleted.
- Now let's have our NodeJS server host the image
  - GOAL: Host the image locally on our NodeJS server and serve it up so that it appears on the bottom of the landing page, DO NOT use the igm.rit.edu link above
  - HINT: See *Simple HTTP HW* for the required code - in that HW we served the **spongegar.png** image under the **dankmemes** endpoint

### II-C. Stream Media HW
- The assignment is in Week 2 content section of myCourses
- The "done" example is here:
  - https://acjvks-streaming-media-fall-20.herokuapp.com
  - https://acjvks-streaming-media-fall-20.herokuapp.com/page2
  - https://acjvks-streaming-media-fall-20.herokuapp.com/page3
- Here's a screenshot of the headers:

 - Many of the concepts were already covered in the *Simple HTTP HW*:
   - CommonJS modules with `require()` and `module.exports`
   - `onRequest` "request handler" for `http.createServer()`
   - URL endpoints
   - sending status codes (ex `200 Ok`) with `response.writeHead()`
   - sending content-type headers (ex. `content-type: image/png` or `content-type: text/html`) with `response.writeHead()`
   - sending content (text or PNG media types) with `response.write()`
 - New concepts covered in this HW:
   - new status code for streaming: `206 Partial Content`
   - new `content-type` values - `video/mp4` and `audio/mpeg`
   - new headers for streaming: `Content-Range` and `Accept-Ranges`
   - new methods for streaming: `fs.createReadStream()`
   - writing a helper function
   - the concept that it a client must make *multiple requests* to a web server for a typical web page:
     - web pages consist of multiple files: HTML, CSS, JS, images, and so on
     - the first file that a client (ex. Web Browser) downloads is usually the default HTML file that is located at the URL the user typed into the browser (or link that they clicked on)
     - the additional files (CSS,JS, images) are requested after the client begins to parse the HTML page
     - each of these files must be individually requested by the client app 
     - the client then "assembles" the web page and displays it to the user
     - this means that we have to create an *endpoint* for each file (HTML,CSS, media, etc) in our `onRequest` handler
   - let's check the HW to see if you got it right!

## IV. Notes for HTTP API Assignment
- This is a *substantial* assignment - so get started ASAP
- See *Week-3/Class Examples* in myCourses for links to helpful code
- See the 2nd and 3rd YouTube videos ("Rich Media 2 - Week 3.2 Accept Headers" & "Rich Media 2 - Week 3.3 Status Codes") linked under *Video Lectures/Week 3 Videos* in myCourses

### IV-A. Accept Header Example
