## II. DomoMaker A - Assignment Walkthrough

- The architecture of this app is very similar to the *Simple Models* HW
  - **app.js** to load the dependencies and start up the express server
  - **router.js** to call the various routes with code defined in the **controllers/** folder
  - a **models/** folder that contains mongoose models (one per file) such as **Account**
- Note: the **client.js** code is all [jQuery](https://jquery.com/):
  - why? `jQuery.animate()` I guess ...
  - here's a nice overview - [jQuery Fundamentals - jquery Basics](http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/jquery-basics)
- Create an account with **signup.handlebars**
  - `<input id="pass" type="password" name="pass" placeholder="password"/>`
  - note that the `type` is `"password"`
  - **models/Account.js** is a mongoose model for the user's account
    - properties are `username`,`salt`,`password` (encrypted), `createdDate`
    - we encrypt the typed in password with node's built-in **crypto** library:
      - https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_pbkdf2_password_salt_iterations_keylen_digest_callback
      - https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_randombytes_size_callback
  - `controllers/Account.js` uses `signup()` to call `AccountModel.generateHash()` and generate an encrypted password
  - password encryption:
    - clear text
    - encryption

      - https://md5calc.com/hash/md5/12345678
    - rainbow tables:
      - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-rainbow-table-attack/
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table
    - salt
      - https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/17421/how-to-store-salt
      - https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/100898/why-store-a-salt-along-side-the-hashed-password
  - Mongo database
    - locally you will probably be using `mongod` (probably), and on Heroku you will be using your MongoDB cloud account
    - you will be able to see the following in a mongo client (`mongo` in Terminal/Powershell or the **MongoDB Compass** app:
      - the database name is set via `dbURL` and is `DomoMaker`
      - the collection is named `accounts` and is autogenerated by `mongoose` in **models/Account.js**
      - each user is a document in the `accounts` collection
      - handy mongo commands:
        - `show dbs`
        - `use DomoMaker`
        - `show collections`
        - `db.accounts.find().pretty()` // show all documents in the accounts collection
        - `db.accounts.remove({})` // delete all documents in the accounts collection
