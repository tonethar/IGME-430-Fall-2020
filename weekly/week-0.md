  - Invites:
    - Change your nickname to your real name & section (ex. "Grace Hopper 01")
    - Post an Intro
  - Professional/SFW: Be aware of your status text (ex. "f-ing losing at Fortnight!" won't cut it)

    - The PDF of this article is in myCourses
    - Zoom - hold space bar to talk. But before you ask a question, first ask yourself "will others benefit from the answer to this question?"
      - if not, then post to the class Discord `#live-chat` channel
      - otherwise, please ask questions! 
 - Attendance/Participation/Engagement (10% of grade)
   - Zoom meetings
     - be on time (there's a waiting room for our Zoom meetings, so it's pretty obvious when someone is late)
     - keep web cam on, and microphone muted
     - you could get called on at anytime, so be ready to respond 
   - Discord Invite & Introduction & Logistics Survey
     - if I have to ask multiple times, it will hurt your participation grade
   - There will be several (graded) Discord discussion threads during the semester
