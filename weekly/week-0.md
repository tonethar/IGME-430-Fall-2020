# Week 0 (8/20/20)

## I. Overview
- Welcome to the course!
- Make sure you read the syllabus linked from the main landing page here --> [README.md](../README.md) 
- What is this course about?
  - Up until now, you've been programming mostly on the *client-side* (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), and then FTPing your pages up to banjo, which is a basic HTTP web server
  - #1 - In this course we will learn how to write code and create our own *web servers* - thus we will be doing *full-stack* development (both front-end AND back-end)
    - How to work with the HTTP protocol
    - How to retrieve/pass/store data on our customized web server
    - How to authenticate users
    - How to author distributed systems [(Redis)](https://redis.io/)
    - In this course, we'll be doing the front and back-end programming in the SAME language (JavaScript). This can be a little confusing for people because they have to keep straight in their head the following - "Is this JS code running on the *front-end* (the browser) or the *back-end* (a Node.js server)"
  - #2 - Work with a modern MVVM framework (React, which is similar to Vue.js)
  - #3 - Modern Software Development Concepts (GitHub instead of FTP for posting code, code validation via linting, build/continuous integration tools such as Webpack & CircleCI)

## II. Example Projects

## III. Communication

- What name do you call me?
  - "Professor", "Professor Jefferson", or "Tony" all work
- Discord
  - Invites:
    - Change your nickname to your real name & section (ex. "Grace Hopper 01")
    - Post an Intro
  - Professional/SFW: Be aware of your status text (ex. "f-ing losing at Fortnight!" won't cut it)
- Zoom Professionalism
    - Article link (paywalled): https://www.wsj.com/articles/seven-rules-of-zoom-meeting-etiquette-from-the-pros-11594551601
    - The PDF of this article is in myCourses
    - Zoom - hold space bar to talk. But before you ask a question, first ask yourself "will others benefit from the answer to this question?"
      - if not, then post to the class Discord `#live-chat` channel
      - otherwise, please ask questions! 
 - Attendance/Participation/Engagement (10% of grade)
   - Zoom meetings
     - be on time (there's a waiting room for our Zoom meetings, so it's pretty obvious when someone is late)
     - keep web cam on, and microphone muted
     - you could get called on at anytime, so be ready to respond 
   - Discord Invite & Introduction & Logistics Survey
     - if I have to ask multiple times, it will hurt your participation grade
   - There will be several (graded) Discord discussion threads during the semester
   
## IV. Week-0 Assignment

- *Review of basic npm & node* is due next Wednesday night - see myCourses dropbox for instructions/video links

## V. Week-0 Introductions ("Do I have to?" - YES!)
- Introductions - we'll do this alphabetically - so be ready:
 - 1) name/major/year
 - 2) where you are physically located right now

 - 4) something interesting you did this summer
 - "Next!"
 
 ## VI. Questions?
