# Week - 1 (8/25/20 & 8/27/20)

## I. Overview

- Last time we got familiar with running `node` and `npm` on the command line, and installing packages (i.e. "libraries")
- Today we are going to look at some of the other tools we'll be using in this course:
  - Heroku is a *platform as service* - https://www.heroku.com/platform
  - We will be deploying our apps to Heroku using Git and GitHub

## II. Platform as a Service

- See ***Cloud Servers & Version Control*** slides in myCourses
- Heroku - *platform as service*:
  - can run code for us in PHP, Python, JavaScript, Java and so on
  - has many "add-ons" (databases such as Mongo, authentication systems etc...)
  - *scalable* - it does *load balancing* with "Dynos"

## III. GitHub & Version Control

- See ***Cloud Servers & Version Control*** slides in myCourses
- Workflow:
  - we use a local git repository, and push our changes to GitHub when we want
  - GitHub can be set up to then push our code to Heroku
  - Heroku will then update and relaunch our app
  - we can set up this "connection" up in the Heroku control panel
- Demo:
